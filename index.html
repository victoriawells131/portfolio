    <h2>Letter of Introduction</h2>
  
	<p>Dear John Doe, As a student always seeking to learn new things, I am excited and privileged to have found this opportunity of being an employee for you all. I always like to say that there's a place for everyone at any company and not limited to one that specializes in a certain field. My skills are not limited to technical abilities as being well rounded in all areas is one of my long term goals. Though, I do excel at writing, editing, and research as it's something I'm familiar with. I am certain that I would take advantage of the training and experience received during this internship-allowing myself to apply it to future endeavors.

	Reading the qualifications for the position, I'm already fitting myself here. I'm intrigued to see the content the you all work with and how I could be able to assist. Even though I do specialize in IT, I have an interest in communications and marketing. I'm currently completing the Google certificate for Marketing and would love to use this new found knowledge soon.

	I would be thrilled to work at a meaningful organization like yours where I would be able to grow through experience and learn at the same time. Doing work that benefits and has an impact on people is very important to me. Please refer to my attached resume for additional information regarding my proficiencies and achievements. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Yours sincerely,
Victoria Wells.
